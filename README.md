# Image Recognition Using Logistic Regression

* In this project first the logistic regression algorithm is implemented.
* It is then used to classify an image to a car or non - car image.
* The  training set consists of 600 images of which 300 are cars and the other 300 are not.
* The test set consists of 250 images with 125 cars and the other half as non cars.
* The model is trained for 100 iterations with 0.01 learning rate and the reducing cost is also visualized for every iteration.
* On testing the algorithm gives 95.19% accuracy.
